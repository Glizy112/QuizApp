# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Steps to run the application
- Fork the repo or download the zip and extract it locally.
- Start the code editor of your choice and open the project code files.
- Then run this command: `yarn install`. This would install all the dependencies required for the project in package.json.
- Finally, run `yarn dev` to start the application.
